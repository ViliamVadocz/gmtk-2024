# Alion Playtest notes

- R is intuitive (but pressed Esc once)
- alion did not notice that climb was added, but figured it out soon
- stuck on 3rd checkpoint
    - missing info: "if it cannot execute, it jumps back"
- spam F breaks the game
- alion found a new solution for the drop down: `( D ) W W J` 
- you can cheese the second to last checkpoint by just doing: `T W W W W D W`
- missing info "robot always faces right on checkpoint"

- `T ( W ) D ` first left-going checkpoint
- `T ( W J ) D` second left-going
- `T (( W C ))` return to checkpoint 3
- no clear ending
- speed up might be necessary

- `( ( W ) J ) C T J` or `(W C T J) T`
- going to previously taken checkpoints
- moving the camera with the mouse

# L0la

- `D ( W ) J D` for downwards checkpoint

- second checkpoint is "too EZ"
- "I don't understand the mechanic"

- control flow unclear
- down is understandable - nice that they can immediately try it out

- animation to turn around at the checkpoint (if facing wrong way)

- `( J ) W C T` to reach up
